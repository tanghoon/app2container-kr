In this step, App2Container generates artifacts needed to deploy your application container in AWS, based on application analysis and best practices.

You have two options for deployment to your target container management environment (Amazon ECR with Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS).

{{% notice note %}}
In this scenario, you will deploy your application container into Amazon Elastic Container Register (Amazon ECR) with Amazon ECS.

1. Run the following command to create the AWS CloudFormation template

    ```bash
    app2container generate app-deployment --application-id <java-app-id>
    ```

2. The process will take few mins. You should see the below output.

    ```bash
    root@ip-10-0-0-129:/home/ubuntu# app2container generate app-deployment --application-id java-tomcat-21fb1eb0
    ‚úî AWS prerequisite check succeeded
    ‚úî Docker prerequisite check succeeded
    ‚úî Created ECR Repository
    ‚úî Registered ECS Task Definition with ECS
    ‚úî Uploaded CloudFormation resources to S3 Bucket: app2container-bucket-0121
    ‚úî Generated CloudFormation Master template at: /root/app2container/java-tomcat-6c144e52/EcsDeployment/ecs-master.yml
    üëç CloudFormation templates and additional deployment artifacts generated successfully for application java-tomcat-21fb1eb0

    üí° You're all set to use AWS CloudFormation to manage your application stack.
    ```

With this command, App2container does the below steps:

1. Creates an Amazon ECR repository and copies there the application container image you have created.  
   - Verify this by logging into the AWS Console and navigating to Elastic Container Service (ECS) Service.
     - Click "Amazon ECR" on the left pane.
     - You will see that your container is automatically registered with this ECR repository.
     ![ecr-1](/create-deployment-artifacts/deployment-ecr.png)
     - Once you click into your Repository, you will see that your container image with the "latest" tag is deployed.
     ![ecr-2](/create-deployment-artifacts/deployment-ecr-2.png)
{{% notice note %}}
You can update this tag and other container parameters in "analysis.json" file.
{{% /notice %}}  
2. Creates an ECS Task Definition and registers it with ECS.
    - NOTE: ECS Task definitions is required to run docker images in ECS. For further information about Task Definitions, you can check <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html" target="_blank">Amazon ECS Task Definitions</a>.
    ![ecs-task-definiton](/create-deployment-artifacts/deployment-task-definition.png)
3. Uploads all CloudFormation resources to your selected S3 bucket.
    - NOTE: You have defined this bucket earlier in  [Install & Initialize App2container]({{< ref "/app2container-steps.it.md" >}}) section.
    - Navigate to the AWS S3 console and click on the bucket created by you.
    - You will see that all the deployment artifacts are uploaded in this bucket.
        ![ecs-task-definiton](/create-deployment-artifacts/deployment-s3-bucket.png)
4. Creates a CloudFormation template.
    - App2Container reviews your environment and updates the CloudFormation template with configuration defined in the previous steps, results of application analysis
    - This CloudFormation template describes all required resources and their dependencies so you can launch and configure them together as a stack.
    - On your web-server, locate the ecs-master.yml file location from your "app2container generate app-deployment" command output and open the file.

{{% notice note %}}
You do not need to make any changes in this file now, but be aware that you can customize it based on your requirements
{{% /notice %}}  

```bash
cat /root/app2container/<java-app-id>/EcsDeployment/ecs-master.yml
```

Congratulations!, you are now all set and ready to deploy your Java Application to AWS ECS! Continue with the next section to trigger the deployment.
