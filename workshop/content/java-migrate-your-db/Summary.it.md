### Congratulations

You have successfully:

1. Created a new managed database, using **Amazon Relational Database Service**
2. Created an **AWS Database Migration Service replication instance** - that allows you to replicate data between databases
3. Created the **source and target database endpoints**
4. Modified the configuration of the source database to allow for **continuous replication of data** (This activity was done for you in this workshop)
5. Started the replication of data through a **replication task**
6. Updated your source Web Application's database connection settings with newly migrated RDS endpoint.

So now it's time to containerize and deploy your Java application to AWS Cloud.
